# Final Project: Austin Animal Center Analysis

### About This Project

This repository contains an applied data science project analyzing intake and outcome data from the **Austin Animal Center (2013–2025)**.

The analysis focuses on **repeat intakes of dogs**, exploring:
	•	Which dogs are most likely to return to the shelter
	•	How intake type influences outcomes
	•	Patterns across breed, sex, and neuter status
	•	Seasonal and pandemic-related trends

This project was originally developed as part of **DACSS 601: Introduction to Data Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (Summer 2025)**.
